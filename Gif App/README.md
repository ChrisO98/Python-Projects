This is a gif application that takes in 6 photos. 
To upload a file in the program, you need to take in the directory link of the file you want to upload. 

Example: C:\Users\doze\Pictures\wolf.png

After you have chosen directory link you would paste it into the text box field, and then repeat the process to 6 images.
This is my attempt to create such a program and while it works it could be better such as adding in an "upload file" button.
